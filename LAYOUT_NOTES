Screen size: width=1920, height=1080
Slider size: width=92, height=463 (slider height + 82)

So ~20.9 Sliders would fit left to right (probably less with padding)
~2.3 Sliders would fit stacked vertically (this is with 128 choices)

Normally 3 pixels/tick.  Slider height == (num_ticks - 1) * tick, so 381 for num_ticks 128

A quarter note at 60 bpm has a duration of 1 sec.  1% is 10mSec.
Note On % (+/- 50 step 3-5, so 35-21 == height 184-142)
Note Velocity (+/- 63 step ?)
Note Off % (+/- 50 step 3-5, so 35-21)

Buttons are 31, but need to be treated like 57 when next to another button.  Text could be in this
area.
